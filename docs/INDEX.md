# Documentation index

**When an AI agent buys something and it never arrives, Clearwake lets the buyer's agent and the seller's agent settle it inside PayPal within an hour, with proof, before it becomes a claim or a fee, and nothing is paid twice.**

**When an agent's order goes missing, agents fix it.**

**Real PayPal sandbox run, 11 November 2026.** 10 orders bought by an agent, 10 item not received disputes. 4 settled by the two agents at INQUIRY, before a claim, USD 20.00 refunded. USD 0.00 overpaid against USD 2,633.25 for an agent on the PayPal Agent Toolkit alone.

## Start here

**Real PayPal sandbox run, 11 November 2026:** 10 orders bought by a buyer agent, 10 item not received disputes. 4 settled at INQUIRY, before a claim (24 to 62 minutes from filing to RESOLVED in PayPal's timestamps, `data/runs/settle-times-20261111.json`), 3 answered with proof and now under PayPal review, 2 awaiting the merchant owner, 1 refused by the buyer's mandate. 0 double refunds. PayPal moved 4 cases to CHARGEBACK once tracking was on the order. The run file is `data/runs/batch-sandbox-20261111-132948.json`.

**Planted failure, 200 episodes:** USD 2,633.25 overpaid by an agent using PayPal's Agent Toolkit directly, USD 0.00 with Clearwake.

Run it with one command: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Sriharsan/clearwake-paypal.git && cd clearwake-paypal && python -m clearwake --port 8810`, then open `/console`. Built during the hackathon: dated in [HACKATHON_UPDATES.md](HACKATHON_UPDATES.md) and [../BUILT_DURING_HACKATHON.md](../BUILT_DURING_HACKATHON.md).

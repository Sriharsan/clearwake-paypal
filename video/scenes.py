"""The nine scenes of the Clearwake video (VIDEO_SCRIPT.md), one function each.

Each scene function takes a Recorder (scripts/record_scene.py), opens its page, scrolls to the first frame it wants, calls rec.begin()
and then moves, hovers, clicks and scrolls at a human pace. Everything before rec.begin() is cut away. The recorder holds the last
frame until the scene reaches its script window, so a clip is as long as its slot in the script.

Scenes that need a voice (the rules by voice, the two real decisions) are stubs for the agent that builds them: the signature,
the window and a TODO with the steps. The recorder refuses to run a stub.

Sri speaks the narration. The line of each scene is kept here only so timing.json can show it in the slot.

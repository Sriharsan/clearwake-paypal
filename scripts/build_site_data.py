"""Build the data the public Control Room grid reads, from the recorded runs.

  python scripts/build_site_data.py

Writes site/data/ledger.json (the real sandbox cases c, d, e, i, m, n, o) and site/data/manifest.json,
which lists every *.json file in site/data/ so the page loads them all. To add rows, drop a file in the
format below into site/data/ and run this script again (or add its name to manifest.json by hand).

File format (UTF-8 JSON), also documented in docs/ and read by site/ledger.js:
  {"source": "short label", "recorded": "YYYY-MM-DD", "rows": [ROW, ...]}      (a bare list of rows also works)
ROW (same keys as the local console's dispute ledger, so a console row can be dropped in unchanged):
  dispute            string, required, unique: the PayPal dispute id, or the refund id for a refund row
  case               string: case letter or batch number
  kind               "dispute" or "refund" (default "dispute")
  reason             PayPal reason code or short text

  stage              "INQUIRY" or "CHARGEBACK" from dispute_life_cycle_stage, "" for a refund
  paypal_status      PayPal's status as read back, for example "RESOLVED"
  state              the Checker's word: "VERIFIED", "UNKNOWN", "PENDING"
  due                seller_response_due_date as ISO 8601 UTC; when present the Deadline cell counts down live
  proposed           the model's (or scripted agent's) proposed action, or "" when the receipt has none
  model              who proposed it, for example "scripted, not AI" or the model name; "" when none
  decided            the policy decision, as words
  outcome            one line: what PayPal's record shows at the end
  fee_avoided        string, USD
  settled_before_escalation   true when PayPal read RESOLVED at INQUIRY
  dispatch           dispatch proof line, or ""
  message            what the buyer wrote, or ""
  record             object: the PayPal record fields the run saved (shown as JSON in the row detail)
  receipts           optional site path of the signed log for this row, for example "receipts/case-n-settle.ndjson"
  result             optional "settled", "evidence", "escalated" or "open": the bucket the Home totals count it in
  refunded           optional true when PayPal shows a refund paid on this dispute
